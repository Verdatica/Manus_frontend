# Manus API Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for integrating real Manus API functionality into the bio-materials dashboard, replacing the current simulation with actual API calls.

## Current Implementation
- The dashboard has a well-structured framework for search functionality
- `manus-api.js` contains a `performManusSearch` function that currently returns simulated data
- Context-aware search capabilities enhance queries based on application context
- Search interface connects UI elements to the search functionality

## Integration Approach

### 1. API Endpoint and Authentication
- Use Manus's info_search_web tool as the primary API endpoint
- Parameters to include:
  - `query`: The enhanced search query
  - `date_range`: Time filter based on user preferences
- Authentication will be handled through the Manus environment

### 2. Query Formatting
- Maintain the current query enhancement logic in `enhanceQuery` function
- Ensure queries are properly formatted for Manus's natural language understanding
- Preserve context-aware enhancements for application-specific searches

### 3. API Connection Implementation
- Update `performManusSearch` function to make actual API calls
- Replace the simulation code with real API requests
- Use JavaScript's fetch API or axios for making HTTP requests

### 4. Response Processing
- Process API responses to match the expected format for the search interface
- Map Manus search results to the material object structure expected by the UI
- Preserve the current result processing logic in `processSearchResults`

### 5. Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling for API failures
- Add timeout handling for slow responses
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Add caching for frequent searches to reduce API calls
- Implement request throttling to prevent API rate limiting
- Add loading indicators for user feedback during API calls

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a new function for making actual API calls to Manus
2. Update `performManusSearch` to use this new function
3. Implement response mapping to match expected format
4. Add error handling and loading states
5. Test with various query types
6. Refine based on test results

## Future Enhancements
- Add user feedback mechanism for search result quality
- Implement advanced filtering based on Manus capabilities
- Consider adding a "conversational mode" for iterative searches
