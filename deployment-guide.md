## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Traditional Web Hosting

### Option 2: Cloud Storage Hosting

1. **Extract the ZIP file** on your local computer
2. **Upload the files** to a cloud storage bucket
3. **Configure the bucket** for static website hosting
4. **Set up a custom domain** (optional)

#### Step-by-Step for AWS S3:
1. Create an S3 bucket with a unique name
2. Upload all files from the extracted ZIP
3. Go to "Properties" > "Static website hosting" > "Enable"
4. Set "index.html" as both the index and error document
5. Under "Permissions", update the bucket policy to allow public access

#### Step-by-Step for Google Cloud Storage:

2. Upload all files from the extracted ZIP
3. Make the bucket public: "Permissions" > "Add" > "allUsers" with "Storage Object Viewer" role
4. Go to "Website Configuration" and set "index.html" as the main page

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Extract the ZIP file and commit all files to the repository
3. Go to repository "Settings" > "Pages"
4. Select the branch containing your files (usually "main")
5. Click "Save" and GitHub will provide a URL for your site

### Option 4: Netlify (Recommended for Simplicity)

1. Create a Netlify account at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Go to "Sites" > "Add new site" > "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop the extracted folder from the ZIP file
4. Netlify will automatically deploy your site and provide a URL
5. You can set up a custom domain in the site settings

## Post-Deployment Steps

After deploying the website, you should:

1. **Test all functionality** by navigating through the site
2. **Verify all links** are working correctly
3. **Check the site on mobile devices** to ensure responsive design works
4. **Set up analytics** (like Google Analytics) to track usage

## Customization

To customize the dashboard:

1. **Modify the HTML files** to change layout, colors, or content
2. **Update the sample data** in the JavaScript sections to include your own materials
3. **Add additional pages** by creating new HTML files following the same structure
4. **Customize the CSS** by modifying the inline styles or linking to external stylesheets

## Future Enhancements

Consider these enhancements for future versions:

1. **Backend Integration**: Add a real database instead of the sample data
2. **User Authentication**: Implement login functionality for saved searches
3. **Advanced Search**: Enhance the natural language processing capabilities
4. **Material Comparison**: Add side-by-side comparison features
